 <p>On May 31, 2025, the Allianz Arena in Munich hosted the UEFA Champions League Final between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Inter Milan.<br>
   This marked PSG's second appearance in a Champions League final, while Inter Milan returned to the final for the second time in three years. The match was a showcase of contrasting football philosophies and club ownership models: PSG, backed by Qatari investment, featured a youthful and dynamic squad under manager Luis Enrique, whereas Inter, owned by American firm Oaktree Capital, relied on experienced players and tactical discipline under Simone Inzaghi. The game concluded with PSG securing a 2-1 victory over Inter Milan, earning their first-ever Champions League title and completing a historic treble for the club. The Allianz Arena, with a reduced capacity of 64,500 for the final, provided a vibrant atmosphere for this memorable encounter.</p>
